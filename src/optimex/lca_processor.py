Time-explicit LCA data processing for optimization.

This module provides classes and utilities for performing time-explicit Life Cycle
Assessment (LCA) computations using Brightway. It processes
temporal distributions of product demands, constructs foreground and background
inventory tensors, and prepares characterization factors for optimization.
