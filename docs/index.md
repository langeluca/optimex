# Time-Explicit Life Cycle Optimization with optimex

`optimex` is an open-source Python package for **time-explicit Life Cycle Optimization (LCO)**. It finds optimal technology transition pathways while accounting for *when* emissions occur and *how* product systems evolve over time.

Standard LCA evaluates predefined product systems. But transition planning asks a different question: *which technologies should be deployed, when, and at what scale*? That is the domain of Life Cycle Optimization. In fast-changing energy and industrial systems, static formulations can be misleading because construction, operation, and end-of-life happen at different times, while background supply chains and technology performance evolve in parallel.

`optimex` closes this gap by combining temporalized LCA with optimization in one workflow, so pathways can be assessed against both time-specific and cumulative environmental constraints.

## Why Go Time-Explicit?

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   :lucide-hourglass:{ style="color: #4dabf7; margin-right: 0.25rem;" } **Distribution of Flows**

    ---

    Map life cycle exchanges across their actual timeframes via convolution, capturing time lags between construction, operation, and end-of-life.

    ---

    Track vintage-dependent foreground improvements and links to prospective background databases reflecting supply chain decarbonization.

    ---

    Separate capacity installation from operational dispatch, enabling vintage-specific merit order where cleaner cohorts are utilized first.

-   :lucide-trending-up:{ style="color: #da77f2; margin-right: 0.25rem;" } **Dynamic Impact Assessment**

    ---

    Retain emission timing for dynamic impact assessment (e.g., Radiative Forcing, dynamic GWP), capturing how impacts accumulate over time.

## What This Enables

Time-explicit LCO reveals transition strategies that are invisible to static approaches:

- **Vintage-specific dispatch** — When multiple cohorts of the same technology coexist, the optimizer preferentially utilizes cleaner vintages, creating an emissions-aware merit order
- **Resource bottleneck navigation** — Time-specific constraints on water use, critical minerals, or other resources force technology diversification, revealing realistic pathways through transient scarcity
- **Strategic overcapacity** — Early investment in clean technologies can offset stranded fossil assets when the net emission savings outweigh the embodied impacts of idle infrastructure
- **Cumulative budget compliance** — By tracking exact emission timing alongside dynamic characterization, pathways can be verified against carbon budgets and other absolute limits

## Built on Brightway

`optimex` is deeply integrated with [Brightway](https://brightway.dev). You can model foreground systems with familiar Brightway workflows, add temporal metadata, and convert those models directly into optimization problems.

!!! tip "Re-use Temporalized System Models"

    If you already have a temporalized product system model, e.g., because you made a time-explicit LCA with [`bw_timex`](https://docs.brightway.dev/projects/bw-timex/en/latest/) before, you can directly re-use it with `optimex`.

`optimex` is free and open source software, published under the [BSD 3-Clause License](content/license.md).

## Use Cases

`optimex` is broadly applicable across sectors where temporal dynamics are decisive for sustainability:

- **Evolving supply chains** — Systems depending on electricity, steel, or hydrogen that undergo rapid decarbonization
- **Early-stage technologies** — Processes with significant vintage-dependent performance improvements (e.g., electrolyzers, DAC)
- **Circular economy planning** — Long material residence times create temporal mismatches between primary demand and secondary supply
- **Time-resolved carbon accounting** — Biogenic feedstocks, temporary carbon storage, or CO~2~ removal with varying temporal profiles
- **Multi-regional supply chains** — Sourcing decisions across regions with divergent decarbonization trajectories
